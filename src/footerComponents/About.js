            <h1>About DataTrust</h1>
            <p>The inevitable Cambridge Analytica fiasco demonstrated a systemic failure in personal data privacy. People browse the web in complete ignorance of what’s being done with their data, because, until now, they’ve had little reason to fear.</p>
            <p>With knowledge comes power. DataTrust will empower individuals by providing data privacy information for every website they visit in the form of an AdBlock-esque browser extension, as well as a single-page website that allows people to search any company’s specific policies.</p>
            <p>The functionality of our website is similar to Wikipedia in that you can browse data freely without a username. With a username, you can participate in filling out company privacy policy information, as well as flag and/or endorse certain policies.</p>
            <p>The browser extension is similar to AdBlock in that it is your silent guardian. As you browse the web, you will be subtly alerted when a website's information is not available through DataTrust (think icon color change). At any point, you can click the icon, which will display a small corner window with a visual representation of the current website’s policies. We will highlight info such as: cookies, third-party-selling and volume of data collected in comparison to other websites.</p>
            <p>Once up and running, DataTrust will reach out to as many institutions as possible (FTC, EFF etc) to join our efforts to increase privacy policy transparency.</p>
